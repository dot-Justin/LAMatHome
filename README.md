  <i>LAMatHome helps you expand the functionality of your rabbit r1.</i>
</p>

## Overview:

### Grabbing journal entries:
By using your `hole.rabbit.tech` account token, we can directly fetch journal entries from the API. By doing this, we can efficiently grab your latest journal entry.

### Intention routing and command parsing:
By providing the user's utterance to `llama3-70b-8192` via the [Groq API](https://console.Groq.com) we can determine:

1. If the user is talking to r1, or if it is a command meant for LAMatHome
2. Which integration to call, and what parameters to give it

By doing this, we avoid the user having to learn every command for every integration, and enables natural language commands. It also enables creativity for the LLM to craft texts for you, if you're into automating social interaction.

**Examples:**

|User utterance in journal entry|LLM "rigid command" Output|
|-----------------------|----------|
|"Can you text my roommate Justin on telegram, yelling in all caps, that his music is too loud? Add a few extra exclamation points."|`Telegram Justin YOUR MUSIC IS TOO LOUD!!!`|
|"Can you turn the volume on my computer up to 100 to spite my roommate?"|`Computer Volume 100`|
|"What time does the moon come out today?"|`x`*|

*\*`x` is the output when the LLM decides your intention was to talk to r1, or, that it didn't have enough information. e.g. Name of recipient, platform to send on, etc.*

Then, `llm_parse.py` takes your neatly formatted command, and executes it based on which integration is called, and the parameters.

## Integrations
Below is a list of our current integrations. This list is kept up-to-date.

> [!NOTE]
>
> *Integrations marked with a* ❕ *may need to be saved as a note to work. r1 could interpret these as commands to itself, and not save the query to the rabbithole. This is a result of r1 update 20240603.15/0.8.99(134D8DE) that enabled voice settings.*
> 
> *Integrations marked with a ⚠️ are experimental and may send to the incorrect person/channel based on the way the user utterance is transcribed. This is a limitation of the r1, not LLM Parsing.*


## New User Interface Features

The LAMatHome application now includes a new user interface. This UI provides a user-friendly way to manage and configure various aspects of the application. Below is a detailed guide on how to use the new features available in the UI.

## Main Features

### Start, Stop, and Restart the Program
- **Start Button:** Click the "Start" button to run LAMatHome.
- **Stop Button:** Click the "Stop" button to stop LAMatHome.
- **Restart Button:** Click the "Restart" button to restart LAMatHome. (*This is needed when changing any configuration settings, **OR** Switching between terminal/cli mode and rabbit mode.*)

### Manage Contacts
- **Add Contacts:** You can now add **contacts** and **nicknames** for those contacts. Enter the contact name and nicknames (*comma-separated*) in the provided fields and click the "Add" button.
- **View and Delete Contacts:** The contacts list is displayed in a scrollable frame. Each contact can be viewed, and individual contacts can be deleted using the "Delete" button next to each contact.
- **Two Name Nicknames** The nicknames can have up to two positions. For example: 'My wife', 'Janet J' and for discord 'r1 general' or 'my group'. **ANY** two names or values should work as a nickname so long as the speech-to-text can correctly understand it.

### Configuration Settings
- **Change Configuration Values:** You can change various configuration values directly from the UI. This includes settings like rolling transcript size and maximum retry attempts for the Rabbithole API.
- **Tabs for Easy Navigation:** Configuration settings are organized into tabs for easy navigation.

### Update Environment Variables
- **Update Credentials:** The UI allows users to update their environment variables, such as API keys and account credentials for different services (e.g., Discord, Facebook, Google Home).

### Enable/Disable Integrations
- **Integration Toggles:** The UI provides toggles to enable or disable various integrations, such as Google Home, Telegram, and Open Interpreter.

### Save Path Configuration
- **Set Save Path:** You can set the save path for journal resources in the "LamatHome Save Path" section. This path is used to store resources generated by the application.


## Quick start guide:

**1. Clone the repository and CD into it**

```
git clone https://github.com/dot-justin/LAMatHome 
cd LAMatHome
```
**2. Install dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```
**3. Obtaining your user token from [the rabbithole](https://hole.rabbit.tech/journal/details):**

- *Google Chrome*
   1. Log into the rabbit hole from the link above
   2. Press F12 to bring up the developer console. If this doesn't work, right-click the page, and click inspect. 
   3. Expand the developer console for better viewing

   7. In the new sidebar that opened up, select `Request` in the top navigation bar.
   8. Select everything inside the quotes after `accessToken`. This is your user token.

   Note: Your token will expire 24 hours after you log in. This is out of our control but we are working on a better way.

**4. Obtaining an API key from Groq:**
  1. Go to [console.groq.com/login](https://console.groq.com/login)
  2. Create an account.
  3. Once logged in, go to [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)
  4. Click `Create API Key`
  5. Create a name for your API key. This can be anything you want. Click `Submit`.
  6. Now, a window will pop up containing your API key. Click on `Copy`. After this point, you will not be able to access this key again from the Groq website. (Don't worry too much, you can create and delete keys at any time.)
  7. Back in the ui that popped up earlier, enter your API key in the field for `Groq API Key:`

>[!WARNING]
>
>  NEVER share your user tokens or API keys. They will be stored locally in the program and will only be used to authenticate with official API's.

**5. Running LAMatHome and entering your credentials:**


### Usage guide:
When you want to run LAMatHome, do the following:

Run `main.py` from the root directory

```

`py main.py`

```

### When running LAMatHome, it will bring up a ui. To enter your credentials, Press the LAMatHome Logo.
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/click_here.png" alt="cick_here" width="800"/>
</p>

### This will bring up another window where you can enter your credentials and toggle your configurations. The only required fields are the ones highlighted below: (*Rabbithole Access Token and Groq Api Key*):

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/required.png" alt="LAMatHome" width="800"/>
</p>

### After you enter these, and hit the **START** button, you should be all set up and ready to go!
### This will start the LAMatHome program, and (as long as your token is valid) you can start giving prompts to r1.
---

### *Remember, you can edit your credentials any time by editing the `.env` file inside the root directory of the project **OR** by using the credentials tab in the ui.*

---
### IMPORTANT: If you change any values in the configuration or credentials tab, or want to uppdate and add new contacts, you MUST stop and restart for LAMatHome to recognize the new changes.


### Stopping LAMatHome
---


To stop LAMatHome, you have three options.
1. Via r1 voice prompt (If you can't get this to work, try method 2)
   - Say `Please close/quit/terminate LAMatHome`.

2. Manually
   - Find the command prompt where it's currently running from.
   - Press `Ctrl + C` to exit the program. You may see some errors, this is expected and will not mess up your installation.

3. From the UI(Recommended)
    - Simply hit the **STOP** button to end the program.  

## Configuration
Open the `config.json` file in the root directory of your project. (Use your favorite IDE. A free, lightweight one is [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)) 

OR 

use the configurations tab in the ui

### General config options:
`mode`:
- The only options here are `rabbit` and `cli`. `rabbit` mode will listen to the rabbithole api for journal entries, while `cli` mode will turn LAMatHome into a dumb [OpenInterpreter](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter).

`rabbithole_api_max_retry`:
- This determines how many times LAMatHome will try to connect after failure.

`rabbithole_api_sleep_time`:
- This determines how many seconds LAMatHome will wait between refreshes.

`rolling_transcript_size`:
- This determines how many of your past prompts will get passed to llm_parse. The higher the number, the more "memory" the LLM has.

### Disabling integrations:
If you don't want to use specific integration, no worries!
Find the integration you want to disable. Set each value to `false`, and they will no longer be activated by llm_parse.

Examples:
- `"browsergoogle_isenabled": false,` The `Google` function of the `Browser` integration is **disabled**.
- `"computervolume_isenabled": true,` The `Volume` function of the `Computer` integration is **enabled**.
- `"browser_isenabled": false,` = All of the browser functions are **disabled**, even if the child functions are set to `true`.

### Telegram integration:
To get Telegram running and sending texts on your behalf, some setup is required. Follow this guide:
1. Give LAMatHome any Telegram command. This can be a test, but be aware that the text will be sent after you log in.
2. A Firefox Nightly window (Playwright instance) will open up and request your sign-in.
3. Sign in, and watch the text go through. After this, your session is saved and you won't need to log back in for a long while.

### Google Home integration:
To allow LAMatHome to use your Google Home, you need to follow these steps:
1. Add your `G_HOME_EMAIL` and `G_HOME_PASS` to your `.env` file.
2. Create any Google Home automations that you want to run, using the Google Home mobile app.
   - Example names that work well with LAMatHome: `Lamp on`, `Lamp off` (one for on and off respectively, because there is no toggle option.), `Goodnight`, etc. llm_parse needs to be able to link the user utterance to an automation.
3. Add the verbatim Automation names to config.json, on the `googlehomeautomations` line. There are some examples there, just follow the pattern to add more.
   - `"googlehomeautomations": ["Automation 1", "Automation 2", "Automation 3"],`
4. You should be set! This list that you just configured will be passed to `/utils/llm_parse.py` and if determined to be run, will run! Ask r1/LAMatHome to "Turn on the lamp in my room" or "Turn off my tv".

## Other information:
### Errors you may run into:
|Error|Meaning/Fix|
|-|-|
|`500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://hole.rabbit.tech/APIs/fetchUserJournal`|This means that for some reason, the request to the rabbit API failed. More often than not, this means that your token has expired. While this *can* happen if your token is valid, it is very rare. [Instructions to obtain user token](https://github.com/dot-Justin/LAMatHome#quick-start-guide)|
|`playwright._impl._errors.TimeoutError: Page.click: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.`|This means that, in waiting for a certain object on the website to load, it never loaded, and Playwright timed out. If this ever happens, please open a [bug issue](https://github.com/dot-Justin/LAMatHome/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md).|

### Prompts:
|Use case|Prompt|
|-|-|
|Get r1 to just say "ok" in response to commands:|`From now on, whenever I give you a command and you think that you can't do it, just reply with okay. Don't reply with any other acknowledgment or any other warning or message, just reply with okay if you cannot do the command. Say "ok" if you understand.`|
